Source code to generate QR code

Hello there! ,

This is a source code to generate QR code in your web browser using Node;
and the web framwork I used is express.js
I  imported some packages from NPM : (ejs,qrcode)

I also used bootstarp for basic Styling purpose but If you don't need you can edit that .
